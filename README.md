2. **Logging**: It utilizes the Python logging module to log different levels of messages (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) during the attack, providing better visibility into the attack process and any encountered issues.

3. **Robust Multithreading**: It launches multiple HTTPS flood attack threads concurrently using threading, improving the attack's efficiency.

4. **Error Handling**: It catches exceptions during the attack and logs them with appropriate error levels for better troubleshooting and debugging.
